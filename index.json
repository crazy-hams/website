    "body": "We are a team of ham radio operators that dared to disrupt the \nstatus quo in the ham radio community. Today, the degree of \nobsolescence present in the technologies surrounding the hobby is \ndangerously high. Most of the widespread services are managed only \nby a few individuals and the risk to find ourselves in a cross \nroad with a legacy park of technologies not able to operate in the \nfuture is a damn reality. Understanding the current situation is \nrisky for all of us, for the future of the hobby and the ham \ncommunity, we understand we must do something now. In few words we \nwant to standardize the technologies in use. We want to reengineer \nthose elements that are obsolete. We want to democratize \ntechnologies and knowledge. You can colaborate or stay expectant. \nIn any case, stay tuned. We are going to make history, \nunfortunately.",
