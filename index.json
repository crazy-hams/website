    "body": "We are a team of ham radio operators that dared to disrupt the
    status quo in the ham radio community. Today, the degree of obsolescence
    present in the technologies surrounding the hobby is dangerously high. Most
    of the widespread services are managed only by a few individuals and the
    risk to find ourselves in a cross road with a legacy park of technologies
    not able to operate in the future is a damn reality. Understanding the
    current situation is risky for all of us, for the future of the hobby and
    the ham community, we understand we must do something now. In few words we
    want to standardize the technologies in use. We want to reengineer those
    elements that are obsolete. We want to democratize technologies and
    knowledge. You can colaborate or stay expectant. In any case, stay tuned.
    We are going to make history, unfortunately.",
