<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a team of ham radio operators that dared to disrupt the status quo in the ham radio community.</p>

<p>Today, the degree of obsolescence present in the technologies surrounding the hobby is dangerously high. Most of the widespread services are managed only by a few individuals and the risk to find ourselves in a cross road with a legacy park of technologies not able to operate in the future is a damn reality.</p>

<p>Understanding the current situation is risky for all of us, for the future of the hobby and the ham community, we understand we must do something now. In few words we want to standardize the technologies in use. We want to reengineer those elements that are obsolete. We want to democratize technologies and knoledge. You can colaborate or stay expectant. In any case, stay tuned. We are going to make history, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Crazy Hams</p>
