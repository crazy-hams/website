<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We are a team of ham radio operators that dared to disrupt the status quo in the ham radio community.</p>

<p>Today, the degree of obsolescence present in the technologies surrounding the hobby is dangerously high. Most of the widespread services are managed only by a few individuals and the risk to find ourselves in a cross road with a legacy park of technologies not able to operate in the future is a damn reality.</p>

<p>Understanding the current situation is risky for all of us, for the future of the hobby and the ham community, we understand we must do something now. In few words <b>we want to standardize</b> the technologies in use. <b>We want to reengineer</b> those elements that are obsolete. <b>We want to democratize technologies and knowledge</b>. You can colaborate or stay expectant. In any case, stay tuned. We are going to make history, unfortunately.</p>

<p><b>Crazy Hams</b></p>
